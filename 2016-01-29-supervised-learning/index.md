# 吴恩达 ML 公开课笔记(1) - Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

This is my notes for the open course [Machine Learning](https://www.AndrewNg's ML.org/learn/machine-learning/) from AndrewNg's ML.

## Supervised learning
0. Model
 - given a set of data assigned with special features(experience)
 - build a model through learning algorithm(task)
 - predict the features through given data using the model built(performance)
1. Regression problem
 -  predict through consecutive data
2. Classification problem
 - pretict between discrete data sets
 - learning from multiple(even infinite) featurea as parameters

## Unsupervised learning
0. Model
 - given a set of data(with no features)
 - build a model through learning algorithm like cluster, etc.
 - classify though the model built, etc. (which means they might have some same features)
1. Cocktail party problem
 - learning from a combination of different audio sources(in different ways, at least 2 ways to identify)
 - separate different sources from the combiniton
